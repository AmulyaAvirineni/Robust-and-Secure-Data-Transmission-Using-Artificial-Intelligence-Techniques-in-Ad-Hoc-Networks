**Introduction**

- This project is titled as “Robust and Secure Data Transmission Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Ad-Hoc Networks”. It presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance

**Project Scope**
   
 - This project is titled as “Robust and Secure Data Transmission Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Ad-Hoc Networks”. This project involves the development of Innovative solutions to enhance the security and reliability of data communication in decentralized, dynamic environments. Ad-hoc networks, characterized by their self-configuring nature and lack of fixed infrastructure, are leads to various security threats such as data interception, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks.

**Features**

- Real-Time Threat Detection
- Adaptive Routing Protocol
- Data Integrity Verification
- Self-Configuring Network

**Architecture**

Steps included in this are:
- Start
- Deploy Nodes and Define Source and Destination Node
- Create Route Using AODV
- Optimize Route Using ABC Algorithm
- Compute Node Properties
- Train Network Using ANN and SVM
- Trained Structure
- If NP Similar to BHA:
Yes: If the node properties are similar to those seen in a black hole attack, the node is marked as BHA and removed from the route. The black hole attack is a type of security attack where malicious nodes drop all packets.
No: If no similarity is detected, the node is considered in the route.
- Compute Results
- Stop

 **Technologies Used**

    - Programming Language: Python (3.7.0)
    - Frameworks/Libraries: PyTorch, Django, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
    - Machine Learning Models: ABC,SVM,ANN
    - Operating System: Windows 8 or above

 **Results**

- With propose algorithm we got throughput as 94.84% 
- Decision Tree we got 81%
- Random Forest we got 86% 
- we can see predicted attack names or normal. 

**Testing**

Types of Testing Implemented:

    - Unit Testing: Ensures individual components work as expected.
    - Integration Testing: Checks the interaction between different modules.
    - Functional Testing: Validates the system against defined requirements.
    - System Testing: Ensures the complete system functions correctly.
    - Black Box Testing: Verifies output correctness without knowledge of internal code structure.
