**Introduction**
- This project is titled as “Robust and Secure Data Transmission Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Ad-Hoc Networks”. It presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance

 **Project Scope**
   
 - This project is titled as “Robust and Secure Data Transmission Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Ad-Hoc Networks”. This project involves the development of Innovative solutions to enhance the security 
 and reliability of data communication in decentralized, dynamic environments. Ad-hoc networks, characterized by their self-configuring nature and lack of fixed infrastructure, are leads to various security threats 
 such as data interception, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks
